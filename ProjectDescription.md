# Scrapy-API-Request from https://www.asos.com/women/hoodies-sweatshirts/cat/?cid=11321&ctaref=hp|ww|prime|feature|5|category|loungewear

<br>Within this project data was scraped by using Scrapy and API Request. The goal was to get data from hoodies for women (see attached link)
<br>I started working with Scrapy, but the price was not visible- So I continued with Scraping information from API Request


#name
<br>#price
<br>#product code
<br>#product id

The scraped data is stored in XLSX and JSON
